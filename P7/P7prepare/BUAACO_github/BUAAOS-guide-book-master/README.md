+ TeX Live 2013 or later

+ pygments

+ fvextra.sty

To install pygments in Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt-get install python-pygments
```

### Ubuntu

In `ubuntu`,you can easily build it by `.install.sh`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SivilTaram/BUAAOS-guide-book.git
cd BUAAOS-guide-book
chmod a+x .install.sh
```
And then you can run `.install.sh` to install the all environments.

```shell
./.install.sh
```
And then you have all environments for building it.

If you want to build it,you can do as follow:
```shell
cd guide-book
make
```

And then you will get a `guide-book.pdf` in you directory `guide-book`.

### Windows

You can use `xelatex -shell-escape -8bit guide-book.tex` twice in directory `guide-book`, and you can get `guide-book.pdf`ã€‚

**Note: You should add `\setCJKmainfont{font-name}` to `guide-book.tex` as a result of loss of default zh-fonts in windows.**
