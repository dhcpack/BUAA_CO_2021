/* Overview:
 * 	Allocate a new environment.
 *
 * Pre-Condition:
 * The new child is left as env_alloc created it, except that
 * status is set to ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE and the register set is copied
 * from the current environment.
 *
 * Post-Condition:
 * 	In the child, the register set is tweaked so sys_env_alloc returns 0.
 * 	Returns envid of new environment, or < 0 on error.
