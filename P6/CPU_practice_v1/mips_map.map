ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Pack:2860 - The number of logical carry chain blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device. This design requires 1117 slices but
   only has 300 slices available that allow carry chains.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 1,817 out of   4,800   37%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               1,757
    Number used as Latches:                     33
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:               27
  Number of Slice LUTs:                     10,891 out of   2,400  453% (OVERMAPPED)
    Number used as logic:                   10,888 out of   2,400  453% (OVERMAPPED)
      Number using O6 output only:           8,578
      Number using O5 output only:              59
      Number using O5 and O6:                2,251
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      3
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     4,468 out of   1,200  372% (OVERMAPPED)
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       11,281
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         9,969 out of  11,281   88%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 390 out of  11,281    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         922 out of  11,281    8%
    Number of unique control sets:              10
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              18 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
